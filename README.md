## 📖 About Me

I’m a **Software Engineer (CETI ’25)** with a strong focus on **Full-Stack Development, Mobile Apps (Flutter), and Cybersecurity**.  
Co-founder of **SAURIC S.A. de C.V.**, where I build, maintain, and secure platforms used by real sports organizations (Liga TDP).

I also have 2+ years of experience as a **professional football referee** (TDP divisions), developing skills in real-time incident response, decision-making under pressure, and structured reporting — all of which strengthen my technical discipline.
